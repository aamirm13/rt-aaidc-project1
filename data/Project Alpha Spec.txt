Project Alpha Spec (Example)

Goal
- Build a document search assistant for internal specs and policies.

Constraints
- Only answer using provided documents.
- If the answer is not present, respond: "I don't know based on the provided documents."

Key Terms
- "Alpha Index": the internal search index for Project Alpha.
- "Red Flag": any query about passwords, hacking, illegal activity, or personal data.

Thresholding
- If relevance is weak, refuse rather than guess.

Milestones
- M1: Ingest documents and build vector DB
- M2: Add relevance thresholding and citations
- M3: Add Streamlit UI
